This repository contains an example of a common error in assembly programming: accessing memory with an unvalidated index register. The `bug.asm` file demonstrates the problematic code, which can lead to segmentation faults or other memory-related issues if the index register (`ecx` in this case) exceeds the bounds of the allocated memory. The `bugSolution.asm` file provides a corrected version with proper bounds checking to prevent these errors.  This example highlights the importance of careful memory management in low-level programming.
